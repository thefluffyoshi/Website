    <p align = center>Observing a person's actions, facial expressions and verbal cues to make an inference, based on general nervous actions, the person in question could be lying. These also can be signs of nervousness, so always look for a cluster of actions (many happening right after the other). It depends on the person when doing comfort actions while lying, but the general actions are:<br></p>

    <ul = "genActions">
      <li>Rubbing their hands/neck while talking</li><br>
      <li>If they are standing and putting both or one of their hands on top of their head</li><br>
      <li>Shaking their head no when they are supposed to be saying a truthful statement</li><br>
      <li>Possibly avoiding the question and changing the topic</li><br>
      <li>Saying a lot of unrelated things or overexplaining to overcompensate and seem "authentic"</li> <br>
      </ul>
    </body>

    <p>Generally when a person retells a story, they will recount details instead of what generally happened and what they think will be believeable. Most liars are nervous and may look around to find a way to escape and avoid answering or even eat to have the excuse that they can't talk since it would be rude. Depending on what it is, they will recount it with emotion, they won't repeat themselves when retelling their side. Usually people will fidget when lying/nervous about getting caught. <i>Unless you personally know the person and know how they normally talk, such as a cluster of cues that are seen as lying, then disregard. You would have to focus on emotions and incongruent movements. Always look for movements/facial expressions one after the other.</i></p>

<br><p>Liars usually cannot hide what their subconscious thinks. They can feel like they fooled you and the corners of their mouth go up. To them, emotions are like light switches. They turn on their sad face and can sometimes accidentally switch back to what their subconscious is thinking. The corner of a person's mouth will go up before/during/after their lie.</p>

<p>Body Language can be used anywhere, and not just for looking at who is lying or not. I just focused on the lying aspect of it. Here is where you can learn about general body language for those around you.</p>
